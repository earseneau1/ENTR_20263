# Entrepreneurship History Timeline

## üîî Course Integration

This web-based timeline was built for two reasons: 1) to invite students of **ENTR 20263: Entrepreneurship & Innovation** to explore key historical moments in entrepreneurship, while 2) simultaneously developing fluency with AI-assisted software development workflows. This hands-on experience is designed to complement class discussions on creativity, innovation, and technological change. 

Students may wish to actively contribute to this project as part of their coursework. 

In the required class assignment, students must:

* Research **at least three significant events** in the national history of entrepreneurship and innovation. This report is turned in to D2L. 

Students may optionally:
* Condense what was submitted in class to be posted to this website.
* Then, students will be encouraged to use generative AI tools (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Lamma, etc.) to propose improvements to this website. The purpose of doing so is to get some exposure to increasing role of AI in software development, while also learning about databases, and other technical components of creating digital products.

## üß† Learning Objectives

By using generative AI to interact with the codebase, students will:

* **Explore no-code/low-code workflows**: Understand how platforms like Supabase, GitHub, and modern JS libraries accelerate development.
* **Engage with AI tools**: Use agents and assistants to refactor code, suggest features, and improve UX/UI.
* **Collaborate on software**: Submit feature ideas and enhancements using pull requests.

## ‚ú® Features of the Website

### Interactive Timeline View

* Scroll-driven animation and rich event descriptions
* Designed to visualize key moments in innovation and entrepreneurship

### Supabase Authentication

* **Magic link sign-in** using university emails
* **Approval workflow** for managing new student users
* **Role-based UI** for admin views

### Event Contribution

* Approved students can submit new timeline entries via form
* All entries are stored in a centralized Supabase table

### AI-Friendly Architecture

* Built to encourage experimentation with generative AI
* Lightweight, documented codebase designed for prompt engineering

## üß™ How It Works in ENTR 20263

1. **Sign in** with your university email to trigger the magic link login.
2. **Wait for approval** from your instructor (admin).
3. **Research and contribute**: Add three timeline entries on historically significant events.
4. **Experiment with AI** tools to propose one code or feature improvement.
5. **Offer a reflection** discuss your experience in class on what you learned about software, AI, and the innovation process.

## üîÅ Rebuilding the Project from Scratch

Want to rebuild this project? You‚Äôll need:

* **GitHub**: for code hosting and collaboration
* **Supabase**: for database, authentication, and permissions
* Careful attention to **role-based permissions** so that students can only manage their own data

All of this can be done using free tools‚Äîno paid software is required.
