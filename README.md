# Entrepreneurship History Timeline

## 🔔 Course Integration

This web-based timeline is not just a demo—it's a required assignment in **ENTR 20263: Entrepreneurship & Innovation**. Students will actively contribute to the project as part of their coursework. The assignment invites students to explore key historical moments in entrepreneurship while simultaneously developing fluency with AI-assisted software development workflows. This hands-on experience is designed to complement class discussions on creativity, innovation, and technological change.

As part of the assignment, students are required to:

* Research and contribute **at least three significant events** in the history of entrepreneurship and innovation.
* Use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to propose and implement software enhancements.
* Reflect on the role of AI, databases, and software platforms in entrepreneurial practice.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project is designed not to teach advanced programming but to immerse students in modern AI-enabled software processes. By interacting with the codebase and using generative AI, students will:

* **Explore no-code/low-code workflows**: Understand how platforms like Supabase, GitHub, and modern JS libraries accelerate development.
* **Engage with AI tools**: Use agents and assistants to refactor code, suggest features, and improve UX/UI.
* **Collaborate on software**: Submit feature ideas and enhancements as pull requests with clear AI-generated context.

## ✨ Features

### Interactive Timeline View

* Scroll-driven animation and rich event descriptions
* Designed to visualize key moments in innovation and entrepreneurship

### Supabase Authentication

* **Magic link sign-in** using university emails
* **Approval workflow** for managing new student users
* **Role-based UI** for admin views

### Event Contribution

* Approved students can submit new timeline entries via form
* All entries are stored in a centralized Supabase table

### AI-Friendly Architecture

* Built to encourage experimentation with generative AI
* Lightweight, documented codebase designed for prompt engineering

## 🧪 How It Works in ENTR 20263

1. **Sign in** with your university email to trigger the magic link login.
2. **Wait for approval** from your instructor (admin).
3. **Research and contribute**: Add three timeline entries on historically significant events.
4. **Experiment with AI** tools to propose one code or feature improvement.
5. **Submit a reflection** on what you learned about software, AI, and the innovation process.

## 🔧 Contributing as a Student

* Fork this repo and work in a feature branch.
* Use AI to generate/refactor code (and include your prompts in PRs).
* Clearly describe the reasoning behind your feature in the PR summary.

## 🎓 Educational Outcomes

By completing this project, students will:

* Analyze key events in the evolution of entrepreneurship.
* Understand how modern web tools (e.g., Supabase, GitHub) power real-time apps.
* Recognize the **opportunities and constraints** of AI-generated code.
* Practice proposing and implementing changes without requiring full-stack expertise.
* Develop confidence in engaging with tech as an entrepreneurial toolset.

## 🔁 Rebuilding the Project from Scratch

Want to rebuild this project? You’ll need:

* **GitHub**: for code hosting and collaboration
* **Supabase**: for database, authentication, and permissions
* Careful attention to **role-based permissions** so that students can only manage their own data

All of this can be done using free tools—no paid software is required.
